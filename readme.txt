== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed the plugin but can't see it.  What's wrong? =

If the widget doesn't show up on the Widgets page:
* Check to make sure the plugin was uploaded to the widgets subdirectory.
* Check to make sure the widget plugin is activated.

If the widget doesn't appear on the sidebar once the plugin has been added:
* Make sure the plugin has been added to the correct sidebar.
* Be sure to save changes on the settings form and in the Current Widgets section.
* Make sure the directory name is entered correctly on the settings page

= The widget doesn't work with my theme.  How can I fix this? =

This widget has been tested on a number of themes and is compatible with all truly widget-ready themes.  However, certain formatting settings are "locked" in the code.

The code isn't locked in stone, however.  You may be able to edit the PHP file to adjust things to your particular code.  You may also contact the plugin author for suggestions; these may result in a better plugin in the future.
